# TextRPG
This is an MVP which includes the basic functionality for a text-based RPG game. It is a fullstack application
using Entity Framework and React. 

The game features a dynamic story which is very open-ended, since the player makes multiple choices throughout the game.

The entire application; database, backend and frontend, is deployed on Azure and can be accessed on the link below.
