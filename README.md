# TextRPG
This is an MVP which includes the basic functionality for a text-based RPG game. It is a fullstack application
using Entity Framework and React. 

The game features a dynamic story which is very open-ended, since the player makes multiple choices throughout the game.

The entire application; database, backend and frontend, is deployed on Azure and can be accessed on the link below.  

PLEASE NOTE: When submitting your username for the first time, it might take around 15 seconds for the server to load. This is because the database goes into cold storage if not used for a certain time by any user.
